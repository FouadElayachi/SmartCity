## Description

SmartCity is a mobile application for the eastern region. It consists in giving an overview of the eastern region (especially the city of Oujda) including the news of the region and the trendy places, but especially to help anyone who wants to use the means of public transport which is the Bus.
It's a native application created using Ionic 3 and Angular 4.

### With the Ionic CLI:

Take the name after `ionic2-starter-`, and that is the name of the template to be used when using the `ionic start` command below:

```bash
$ sudo npm install -g ionic cordova
$ ionic start myBlank blank
```

Then, to run it, cd into `myBlank` and run:

```bash
$ ionic cordova platform add ios
$ ionic cordova run ios
```

Substitute ios for android if not on a Mac.
